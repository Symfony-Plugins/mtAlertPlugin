Instalation

  * First of all you must create some methods in the myUser class:

    - you should provide a 'getUsername' method in you myUser class. The username returned by this method should be unique.

  * If you like, you could add you application's credentials in the app.yml

    app.yml
      all:
        mt_alert_plugin:
          credentials: [admin, center_admin, unit_admin, unit]

  * The plugin admin modules should be enabled in the settings.yml file to be able to add and configure alerts

    setting.yml:
      all:
        enabled_modules:        [..., mt_alert_message, mt_alert_message_user, mt_alert_message_credential]

  * There's also a non administrative module that should be seen by everyone. This module show the alerts for the logged user and allows some configuration on them:

    setting.yml:
      all:
        enabled_modules:        [..., mt_alert_message_view]


  * Also you should provide some 'extra methods' if you'd like to send mails. This methods are configured in the 'app.yml' section of the plugin. Three static methods are needed:

    app.yml
      all:
        mt_alert_plugin:
          mail_retrieve_mails_method:                     This method should retrieve the mail address of an array of usernames passed as parameter.
          mail_retrieve_usernames_by_credential_method:   This methos should retrieve the usernames of the user who have a credential passed as parameter.
          mail_retrieve_all_mails_method:                 This should retrieve the mail addresses of all the users of the application.

    This plugin uses the dcMailerPlugin to send mails, so its installation is needed.

  * Full example of the app.yml:

      mt_alert_plugin:
        credentials:                                  [admin, center_admin, unit_admin, unit]
        app_mt_alert_plugin_enable_rich_text:         false
        app_mt_alert_plugin_tiny_mce_theme:           simple
        mail_subject:                                 "App Name | %%title%%"
        mail_from:                                    "address@server.com"
        mail_retrieve_mails_method:                   ['UserHelper', 'getMailsByUsernames']
        mail_retrieve_usernames_by_credential_method: ['UserHelper', 'getUsernamesByCredential']
        mail_retrieve_all_mails_method:               ['UserHelper', 'getAllMails']

  * If you want you can use a rich text editor when creating the alerts. You need to install sfFormExtraPlugin, download the tiny_mce library and set it all up. After that you must enable the rich text feature in the mt_alert_plugin app.yml section

Usage:
  1. Administration:

     Start by the 'mt_alert_message' module to create some alerts.

  2. That's it!


  3. To send mails use the mtAlertPlugin:sendMail task. An application and an enviroment is required:

    php symfony mtAlertPlugin:sendMail --application="frontend" --env="dev"

    This task fetches all the alerts that are active and its condition evaluates to true and sends them to the corresponding users.
